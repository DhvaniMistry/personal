        Hello, I'm Dhvani Mistry, a passionate computer science sophomore at Iowa State University. As an aspiring developer, I find joy in crafting digital experiences that not only function seamlessly but also captivate users. My journey in the realm of technology has been marked by a fascination with both frontend and backend development, and I am on a quest to sharpen my skills and embrace the challenges that come with full-stack development.

        With a solid foundation in computer science and a keen eye for design, I strive to bring creativity and efficiency to every project I undertake. From Java simulations to Python-based games and web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I enjoy exploring diverse domains within the vast landscape of software engineering.

        My academic journey has equipped me with a range of skills, from mastering data structures and algorithms to delving into user interface design and database management. Beyond the classroom, my experiences as a Teaching Assistant and a Student Support Technician have further enriched my understanding of technology's practical applications and its impact on education and user support.

        In this portfolio, I invite you to explore my projects, coursework, and professional experiences. Each line of code and every project represents a step forward in my continuous learning journey. Let's connect and explore the boundless possibilities of technology together!

        Thank you for visiting.
