                            the temperature and humdity data according the plant. The user can add the sensors and name it with that of the plant name the 
                            sensors are kept in. The app then fetched the sensor data and specific plant data and matched the events and lets the user know

                <h3>Crest Data Systems</h3>
                <p><b>Software Engineer Intern | San Jose, California (Remote)</b></p>
                <p>May 2024 - Aug 2024</p>
                <p>
                    As an Intern at Crest Data System, my responsibilities revolved arround writing integration code for the splunk development.
                    My initial training was in Python, giving me an indepth undertanding of different varity of Python libraries including and not only limited black, 
                    pycodestyle, resquest, fastapi. Along with this I progressed skills in splunk. Splunk is a data monitoring and validating tool. In my responsibilities
                    as an intern, I was given the task to create dashboard for logs. We also created splunk applications showcasing and practicing our skills in rest 
                    API calls and ingesting data with the scripts. Also wrote python scripts for scripted input that ingested data by making an API call. Also used checkpoint mechanism
                    to make sure data duplication and data loss. Created modular input for data ingestion. Created AddOn for the same for the application.
